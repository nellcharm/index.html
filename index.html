This site is about Jhonelle's journey and how God has transformed her life to be a true testimony of <em>His glory.</em> <br>

"I have been through countless obstacles throughout life, but God has always been <strong>faithful.</strong> During periods of despair and hopelessness, He has been with me and continues to guide me through life.

I hope to inspire others so they will have no doubt in their hearts that <strong><em> God is real </em></strong>, and is able to surpass all these natural laws that are around us."
